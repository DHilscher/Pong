# Pong Game

A basic pong game using SVGs.

## Setup

**Install dependencies:**

`> npm i`

**Run locally with Webpack Dev Server:**

`> npm start`

**Build for production:**

`> npm run build`

## Keys
**Extra Balls**
* press: b

**Player 1:**

* z: down

**Player 2:**

This project was built completely from javascript. I learned how to use webpack to compile. I also learned how SVG's work and how to build them.

My Stretch goals were to add multiple balls(press b) and extra paddles
